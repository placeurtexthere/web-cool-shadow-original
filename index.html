                Your heart's pounding, your palms are sweaty; fingers twitching. You almost drop your package a few times, but thankfully you make it back to your room before you can cause any real damage to anything.
                You set it down on the bed and immediately tear into the cardboard, pulling out the contents like an excited child. The game is packaged first, of course; a nice holographic box decorated with the cover art. Next comes a little golden figure of the titular character: weighty and solid in feel. It's clearly high-quality stuff. You set both of these aside with a smile and then continue to unpack the box, removing a number of posters and art books that you'll sort out later. Down to one last thing.
                You drag it out, the plastic covering crinkling in your hands as you examine it with a frown. It looks like some kind of hoodie or something, though you hadn't been expecting anything of the sort. There was nothing like this listed on the Amazon page. Maybe it was a pre-order bonus they forgot to mention?
                You unwrap it anyway, tossing the plastic wrapping off onto the ground. At a clearer inspection, you can see it's a Spyro suit, though it's not a very good one; the face is all wrong and the colours are muted and dull. It looks more like a cheap knock-off than an official product.
                Still, it doesn't stop you from inspecting it closer. The material is soft and it feels itchy in your hands. Some kind of cheap fabric, maybe? You think it's an odd choice of material, though considering the cost of production it's probably more efficient than rubber. The mask looks flimsy-- the material seems especially thin here, and the details are all off. The eye holes are far too big, the nostrils are misshapen, and the snout is too rounded. The mouth looks especially silly with the lower jaw hanging open like that, and whenever it’s moved it flops about like a fish. Compared to the figure from before this suit looks unfinished. It looks too goofy.
                You click your tongue in disappointment, but figure you might as well try it on at least once. You did technically pay for it, after all.
                After a quick double-check to make sure you're completely alone in the house, you begin to strip, tugging off each layer of clothing and chucking it onto your now-cluttered bed. You don't care for the moment and ignore the mess,  unhooking the head of the costume from the neck and unzipping the body down to the crotch. It's awkward to squeeze yourself in, but you finally manage to climb inside with a little wriggling, slipping your limbs in first before pulling it over the rest of you.
                The scratchy material is immediately apparent, and every time you move it grazes your skin. You wince but push past it, looking down to admire your form, rolling one hand down over your chest as the other zips the suit back up. The fabric sits surprisingly tight on your skin, and despite your doubts it's a pretty comfortable fit. Thankfully you figure out that some parts of the inside are padded with rubber, like the hands and feet. It’s nice and smooth, and far more comfortable than the furry stuff.
                You can't deny your excitement at this point. Even if had looked a little off at first glance, the suit was starting to feel nice to wear. You grab the mask and shuffle over to your mirror, pushing away the few niggles you have with the design as you pull it over your head. If you could enjoy it for this, at least, it might be a fun little thing to have around for when you're alone.
                The mask does look better now that you're wearing it: with something solid to support the features. With your head filling up the space inside it looks a little more natural, though there's still an element of silliness to the whole thing with the lower jaw flopping around whenever you move. There’s rubber padding here too, making it a whole lot more pleasant to wear, though the cool material seems to stick to your skin. Even the suit seems tighter on your body now, but you put it down to your imagination and instead focus on the other parts of the costume.
                You turn yourself to get a better look at your back. A few of the spines are missing, the wings are limp and far too small, and the fabric hangs loosely over your behind despite feeling tight. Even the tail looks disappointing: the length hangs down like a limp noodle, though that's not too surprising. Still, maybe some kind of stuffing to make it stick up would have been nice.
                You turn back, and then you notice something strange.
                The fabric around the snout is...weird. The jaggy teeth almost look like they're stretching or melting, but that’s even possible. It’s fabric, and you’re pretty sure that fabric can’t stretch like that.
                You watch through the mirror, your eyes wide, as it continues to stretch downwards, almost like treacle, until it meets up with the bottom lip. The strands connect, sticking to the material there.
                And then it snaps shut.
                It’s sudden: near blindingly fast. You jolt forward, catching yourself before you fall. Your heart races. The jaw of the suit has closed in on itself, leaving only the right side partially open. You can feel the air tickling your bare skin there, and only there, but it’s slowly closing up.
                And it’s not just there that’s affected; as you wrench your eyes from the snout of the costume you see it-- and feel it. The suit is shifting somehow, tightening around your body. Fur turns hard and, as you carefully lift a hand to stroke it, cold. You realise with a gasp that the zipper is doing the same, melting and shifting, and just as you make a grab for it the metal melts into the suit, leaving a smooth underbelly in its place.
                The next thing you know is pain. Sharp, and accompanied by a cracking sound. You wince, wrinkling your nose, and to your shock the now rubbery snout crinkles in response, almost as if it was your skin. Your face starts to tingle, and it’s followed by more jabs of pain.
                Your eyes catch sight of something else now: something long and slender snaking about behind you, just off the side of your back. It’s the tail: that floppy, pathetic looking tail, now outfitted with a rubbery sheen. It seems to notice it has your attention, and as if waiting for that curls in on itself to hide. You feel it trail the ribbed tip up the back of your legs, bushing over the insides of your thighs, but as weird as that is there’s no way for you to expect what happens next.
                The tip presses flat against your ass, grinding itself up between your cheeks. You turn with a gasp, frowning, and the mask seamlessly mimics the expression. You don’t see this. Instead, your eyes are fixed on what’s happening behind you. The rubbery material really is tightening around you. The once baggy fabric has completely changed into that same rubber as everywhere else, but more strikingly it defines your ass near perfectly as if it’s skin tight. The tail is taking advantage of that, wriggling its tip around your hole, teasing and prodding, and you can feel it. It’s sensitive, sends shivers running through your body at every touch, and it really feels like it’s groping your own skin.
                You groan, and it pauses for just a second, almost like it’s looking at you with a coy smirk, before realigning and jamming itself inside, pushing your cheeks apart. You can’t stop yourself from falling this time, and the shock sends you crashing down onto your knees, kneeling over onto your hands, and into an even better position for the suit to have its way. The tail digs itself further into your hole, the next ridge thicker and more pronounced. Your body shakes. Heal pools in your stomach is it grinds past your insides, but there’s no discomfort. No pain or anything.
                It stops, then drags itself out, like it’s building suspense. It’s working, anyway: you’re sweating, though you can’t tell if it’s from shock or the tightness of the suit. It’s closing in around you at an alarming rate, but you’re too shocked by everything else to pay it much attention. Even the insides are completely rubber now, and it’s sticking to your skin like glue. There’s another crack as your bones crunch and change. Your nose flattens down and stretches out along with your mouth, but you can’t even feel it. Just that same tingling sensation from before.
                Now you feel the tail moving, seemingly satisfied with the break. It slips inside again, pushing just a little farther than before, the thickest ridge teasing your hole, and a chill runs up your spine at the intrusion. Then it pulls out, but instead of stopping it pushes right back in, building up a gentle rhythm, essentially fucking you. The sensation is so alien, but your body is reacting just as the suit wants. You groan as a chill runs through your crotch, and as you do the last of the snout closes up over your mouth.
                Your limbs are tingling now. The rubber is strangling your skin, squeezing your digits in almost a death grip, but there’s no pain. Bones crack and crunch, and your fingers and toes curl on reflex as the rubber presses in. That same sensation rolls down throughout your entire body as the rubber claims you, crowding around your body until every inch of your skin is covered by it.
                And it feels so damn good. Your brain is soaking in pleasure. It’s fogging your mind, directing all of your attention to the way your body feels, and away from how weird this was. The tail picks up a burst of speed, thrusting in and out rapidly, and you have to dig your rubbery claws into the carpet to even try and ground yourself. Your cock swells, and you even feel the rubber squeezing around it as it hardens, pushing out of your crotch in a sheathe-- something that definitely wasn’t there before.
                The tail suddenly rams itself into you, completely hilting all in one go. You cry out in shocked delight as the third ridge of the tip drives into you with a wet pop, and the ‘mask’ moves in response to your facial muscles. The jaw unseals, the nostrils flare, and a crackle of fire spurts up from your throat. You feel all of it. Every last movement, even the tickle of flame rising up your throat, and the way breath gushes in and out of your open mouth as you pant. A tongue flops out, and you can feel it resting against your jaw. It’s your tongue. It’s your mouth. Your face.
                The suit won’t let you dwell on this. The fucking resumes, harder and faster than ever, eager to completely cloud your thoughts now that it’s transformed you. Your brain complies with little resistance, too shocked and overwhelmed to even fight. Your body sinks into the pleasure as you fuck yourself, and your arousal grows ever stronger without a clear mind to worry about. Eventually, you’re stroking your pink, rubbery cock, grinding your clawed hands up and down the flesh, and it feels even better than your human skin. It’s softer, slicker and far more sensitive. You can still barely feel your human skin beneath it, but the rubber is sealed so tightly to it that it might as well just be your skin now. ‘That’s fine,’ you find yourself thinking, though how much of it is your own thought is hard to tell. ‘I don’t need it. Just need this. This is me.’
                There're a few more snapping sounds as your face finishes up changing. Your eyes are larger to fit the suit, though you feel no tangible difference, and the last of the grey in your irides drips away, replaced by the same purple glow of your skin. The once uneven, purple teeth have pushed out and whitened, becoming hard rubber fangs that wrap around your gums. Your nostrils flare again, and you snort out a puff of smoke as you reach climax.
                You stretch your neck back, expression drawn into ecstasy as thick ropes of cum spurt from your cock and coat your chest. Your tail pulls out but sticks close to your stretched hole, and no amount of effort will move it right now. Complete bliss rolls over your mind in a thick haze, sealing away everything but your arousal: your carnal need. The suit hijacks your brain, and you don’t even care. It feels too good. You want more. You need more.
                Panting and spurting out little embers of flame, you find yourself immediately wrapping your hand around your erection again, reclining back onto your knees. It jolts and twitches as your tail eagerly slips inside of you once more, and without pause you start stroking all over again, losing yourself in this fog of lust.
